As you probably know, Google Chrome is the world's most popular browser, the reason for this is because it is backed by Google, and for a company as large as a Google, the browser is promoted almost everywhere. We see Google Chrome installed in business environments, home environments, it never ends. But surely, for a browser this popular it must be good to an extent. The fact is, it's a brilliant browser, it's powerful, fast and everything most people would ever need.

So, where's the issue here? Why Firefox?

The only competition Google Chrome has is Firefox, that's because those are the only two modern browsers that exist. Why? Because browsers are extremely difficult to create with all the modern technology that is used within them nowadays.

### No! There's others, what about DuckDuckGo or Brave Browser?

They're both Chromium-based, meaning they use the same engine as Google Chrome. This is where Firefox is different, it uses it's own unique engine, Gecko.

### Yeah, but what's Firefox better at?

User control. You can operate the browser how you want. Here's a real example, Google is removing support for [Manifest V2](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/), meaning the functionality of extensions may be severely degraded. Permissions will be more secure and strict. Sounds good, right? After all we need excellent safety measures in our browsers. Unfortunately, it puts a limit on extensions like [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), even though it's sole purpose is to block advertisements, imagine if it couldn't do what it was designed to do. That's the problem with the removal of Manifest V2. Luckily Firefox is keeping support for Manifest V2.

Ultimately, if advertisement blockers are of an importance to you, I highly recommend you switch to a Gecko-based browser (which is essentially a fork of Firefox), [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a browser that I highly recommend!
