### What is [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)?

Linux is a [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) kernel, which is what handles the boot process and the communication between the physical hardware and software.

### What is a desktop environment?

Think of the Windows Desktop, it is Microsoft's Desktop Environment. The difference is that Linux has multiple desktop environments and window managers to choose from.

For example, a desktop environment like [KDE Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Plasma) is one of the most user-friendly desktop environments to use, I highly recommend it for beginners as it's versatile and highly customizable.

### What is a terminal?

Now, this is where things get scary. A terminal is where you enter commands, think of it as complete hacker mode.

Jokes aside, you use a terminal for a numerous amount of things such as installing software, for example:

The command:

```
sudo pacman -S firefox
```

Would install Firefox, and yes it's literally that easy. You don't need to navigate the official website of the software, all you have to do is know the software that you want to install, then enter the install command. Let's break that command down.

- **sudo** means admin privileges; meaning you have to enter your password
- **pacman** is the package manager for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
- **-S** is the **pacman**'s prefix for installing packages.

Now that may have sounded a bit confusing, but just remember that is how you install software.

### Arch Linux? Wait, what! We were talking about "Linux"

Well, yes. Linux has many different flavors, think of it like Bubble Tea.

Bubble Tea has many different flavors; passion fruit, strawberry, blueberry, etc.

You choose your favorite Linux [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions). My favorite is Arch Linux; for it's simplicity, and ease of use. I recommend researching a few popular Linux distributions so you can make an informed decision about which one would work for you the best.

### So, why would I even use Linux in the first place?

With the discontinuation of Windows 10 soon to come, Microsoft users may have to switch to Windows 11 in the near feature for continued updates. This also means software developers will eventually drop support for Windows 10. Microsoft Windows has it's fair share of annoyances such as; advertisements in the start menu, bloatware installed by default, limitations without buying a license the operating system, lack of customization; you are forced to use specific features whether you like them or not.

Another thing is hardware requirements, to upgrade to Windows 11, your computer must meet a certain hardware requirement, which in simple terms means if you have an older computer, the only way you can use Windows 11 is with a bypass, which is not recommended as Microsoft could block access to your computer in the near future.

### However, with Linux...

- It's **open source**, so it's completely trustable, that doesn't mean to say it's completely safe since when the source code is public it is easier to find common exploits; however they are patched by the community almost instantly, if found.

- You can customize Linux however you like! Don't like a specific feature? Remove it! Want to change something? Change it! There is so much choice; multiple desktop environments and windows managers to choose from, display protocols, software, and a lot more!

- Linux is community driven, instead of by a single corporation (Microsoft, Apple) . Which means more user control and freedom to do whatever you'd like.

- Linux can run on a potato, literally. You can run Linux on almost any device thanks to it's outstanding device compatibility.

#### Surely, there must be some downsides

As with anything, of course there is!

- Since Linux is community driven, there is no specific guideline or route to follow, which can make it confusing for beginners.

- Most software that you can obtain on Windows is also available on Linux, but some, for example Adobe Photoshop is **not available**.

- Linux is very stable, but as with most things, incorrectly modifying a component or feature can cause a numerous amount of issues or errors. It is best to know what you are doing before you modify anything which is dependant on something else.

### Anti-cheat

When you play Online Games, there's usually a piece of software that is loaded onto your system to detect/prevent you from cheating. However, on Linux there is no such thing. The result of this is that a majority of Online Games **do not work on Linux**. This is not a fault with Linux, it is entirely the game developer's decision to add a workaround or official support for Linux.

### Ultimately, it's your decision

This article was to spread awareness of Linux, and to let others know that there are alternatives to Microsoft Windows and MacOS.
