In this post, I will explain what Open Source is in an easy to understand way.

### What is software?

Software is anything that runs on a computer. Let's use an "app" for example. Adobe Photoshop is an app, which is a piece of software that runs on a computer.

### Who makes software?

A program consists of code. A programmer, is someone who codes (creates) software. It is their choice if they want the source code to be **public** (open source), so anyone can see or **private** (closed source) where the public **cannot see**.

### Why would someone care if the code is publicly viewable or not?

As a user, your intention is most likely just to use the software. **However**, do we really know what's going on behind the scenes? Is the software safe, or is it sending private user data back to unknown servers? If the software is **open source**, we would know. Since, we could see the code and know exactly what it's doing.

Another benefit is that you can fork the software. Which means you can create a copy of the existing code, implement any features you desire, and finally use it for yourself or redistribute the software.

### Hold on! I can't read code, so how would I know?

Don't worry, that's when you would search for what others have to say about the software, not everyone is a programmer.

### Open Source or Closed Source?

The decision is up to you! You may be required to use specific software for a certain task, and that software may be closed source, however if you trust the company then you probably know you're in good hands. Closed Source software usually have large teams behind them working towards making them user friendly, and more productive.

With open source software, it's a bit different. Usually there's either a single person maintaining the software, or a small group of people who work on the software.
Open source software is dependent on donations, since they are usually free. This is because the code is public so anyone could rebuild the software for themselves free of charge.

Ultimately, I recommend using open source software if:

- The software is productive and fully functional.
- You can get the work done.
- If you like it!
