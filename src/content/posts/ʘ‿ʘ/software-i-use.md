### Surfin' the web

- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), a privacy friendly fork of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). It is the least intrusive browser I've used.

### Firewall

- [simplewall](https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall), one of the most simple, easy too use, reliable firewalls for Microsoft Windows. In my opinion, it is far better then the built-in Windows Defender.

### Multi-Monitor Brightness Control

- [Twinkle Tray](https://github.com/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray), enables you to control the individual brightness of each monitor you have connected.

### Notes

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), my favorite markdown editor. What makes this unique to others is that there's a ton of extensions to choose from, it's highly customizable and if you ever decide to change note-taking software, exporting your notes is as simple as right-clicking the vault and clicking "Copy" and then pasting them into your new software.

### Music

- [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify), is my streaming service of choice, not vanilla, but [Spicetified Spotify](https://github.com/spicetify). It is highly customizable and full of a variety of extensions.

### Game Engine

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), one of the best open source game engines

### Emulators

- [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/), an emulator for emulating [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii) Games
- [Cemu](https://cemu.info/), an emulator for emulating [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U) Games
- [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/), an emulator for emulating [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch) Games

### Code Editors

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it's a pretty decent code editor with a ton of extensions! Don't like how it uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) since it can take up a lot of RAM.

### Desktop Visuals

- [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en), for Windows and Android. You can set live wallpapers as your desktop/home screen background.
