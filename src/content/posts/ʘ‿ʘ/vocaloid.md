**V**ideo **G**ame **M**usic has always been my favorite type of music, and that's probably because you spend a long time listening to them in video games, and you think of the game every time you hear it. On top of that, I've never really been keen on vocals. That is until, I discovered [**Vocaloid**](https://vocadb.net/)!

### A music genre you've probably never heard of before!

To put it simple, it's an [AI-based synthesizer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid) that creates singing voices from lyrics and melodies.

Interested? Here's how to get started:

### 1. Head to the [Vocaloid Tag Listing](https://vocadb.net/Tag)

### 2. You'll see a bunch of different music genres, pick one that seeks your interest.

(For example, [EDM](https://vocadb.net/T/1552))

Once you've selected a tag, you'll see some of the **top artists** for the chosen tag.

### 3. Pick a **music producer**

(For example, [Clean Tears](https://vocadb.net/Ar/20))

From the artist's front page,

### 4. Try previewing a song from one of their **Recent albums**

(For example, [Reverberations](https://vocadb.net/Al/5111))

If you like the song then I highly recommend using a proper streaming service like [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify) to listen to their other tracks. You can also use Spotify's algorithm to discover various other Vocaloid artists.
